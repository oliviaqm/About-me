I am a detail-oriented and goal-focused data scientist with a proven track record of success in big data analysis, as well as machine and deep learning algorithms. My work goes beyond my job description, as I always find ways to get things done efficiently and with high quality. My expertise includes state-space modelling, hyperparameter tuning and feature space optimisation for an ML modelâ€™s optimal performance, data storytelling and visualisation, structured equation modelling (SEM) and omnichannel marketing.

I enjoy generating new ideas and devising feasible solutions to broadly relevant problems. My adeptness in developing and utilising algorithms and models to mine big data stores, perform data and error analysis to improve models and clean and validate data for uniformity and accuracy has enabled my clients to achieve productivity and profitability. My colleagues would describe me as a driven, resourceful individual and team player who maintains a positive, proactive attitude when faced with adversity.

Skills and Specialities: 
Data Storytelling and Visualisation | Data Cleaning and Feature Selection/Engineering | Statistical Analyses
Natural Language Processing | Time series & State Space Modelling | Hyperparameter Tuning | Feature Space Optimisation | Structured Equation Modelling (SEM) | Omni-channel Marketing | Knowledge Transfer

I am eager to further expand my network. Feel free to get in touch with me at olivia.quek@gmail.com
